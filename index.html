            The E5 series (Japanese: E5系, Hepburn: E5-kei) and the related H5
            series (Japanese: H5系, Hepburn: H5-kei) are Japanese Shinkansen
            high-speed train types built by Hitachi Rail and Kawasaki Heavy
            Industries. The E5 series is operated by East Japan Railway Company
            (JR East); it was introduced on Tohoku Shinkansen services on 5
            March 2011[5] and on Hokkaido Shinkansen services on 26 March 2016.
            A total of 59 10-car sets are on order, with three sets in service
            in time for the start of new Hayabusa services to Shin-Aomori in
            March 2011.[6] The H5 series, a cold-weather derivative of the E5
            series, is operated by Hokkaido Railway Company (JR Hokkaido); it
            has been in use on Tohoku and Hokkaido Shinkansen services since 26
            March 2016.[7][8] Ordered in February 2014, a total of four 10-car
            sets were built by Hitachi and Kawasaki Heavy Industries at a cost
            of approximately ¥18 billion (US$169.9 million).[8] The first two
            sets were delivered in October 2014.

            The E7 series (E7系, E-nana-kei) and W7 series (W7系,
            Daburu-nana-kei) Shinkansen are Japanese high-speed train types
            operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and West Japan
            Railway Company (JR West), respectively. They were jointly
            developed. The E7 series has operated since 15 March 2014.[1][2] It
            also operates on the Jōetsu Shinkansen following the March 2019
            timetable revision.

            The N700 series (N700系, Enu nanahyaku-kei) is a Japanese Shinkansen
            high-speed train with tilting capability developed jointly by JR
            Central and JR West for use on the Tōkaidō and San'yō Shinkansen
            lines since 2007, and is operated by JR Kyushu on the Kyushu
            Shinkansen line. N700 series trains have a maximum speed of 300 km/h
            (186 mph), and tilting of up to one degree allows the trains to
            maintain 270 km/h (168 mph), even on 2,500 m (8,202 ft) radius
            curves that previously had a maximum speed of 255 km/h (158 mph).
            Another feature of the N700 is that it accelerates more quickly than
            the older 700 series Shinkansen trains, with a maximum acceleration
            rate of 2.6 km/h/s (0.72 m/s2). This enables it to reach 270 km/h
            (170 mph) in only three minutes. Further advancements led to the
            development of the N700A, an incremental evolution of the N700.
            N700A trains can reach 285 km/h (177 mph) on 3,000 m (9,843 ft)
            curves, allowing the maximum operating speed on the Tōkaidō
            Shinkansen to be raised to 285 km/h (177 mph). All N700 series sets
            have been retrofitted with most of the improvements added to the
            N700A series, and are now classified as "N700A". Because of these
            improvements, trains can travel between Tokyo and Osaka on a Nozomi
            run in as little as 2 hours and 22 minutes on the fastest service (8
            minutes faster than before). A new train, the N700S, entered service
            in 2020 with plans to eventually replace all N700-series trains. The
            first four sets began operation on 1 July 2020.
